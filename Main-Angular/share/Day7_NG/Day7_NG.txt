Angular Revision:

Reactive Forms:
	step 1: create a component
	step 2: import Reactive Fomrs Module.
	
	
	FormBuilder: It is used to create FormGroup, FormControl, FormArray.
	FormGroup: collection of form controls.
	formControl: Single entity of the form.
	
	Validations :
	Template Driven Form:
	
		frm.form.valid: will check the form is valid or not.
		frm.submitted: check form is submitted or not
		fname.invalid: check field is valid or not.
		email.touched: check whether user has touched the email field or not.
		fname.errors: Will return an object related to errors
		email.errors.pattern: check mail pattern is correct or not
		
		
	Reactive Fomrs:
		f.fname.errors?.required: Fname is required or not.
		
		
	* in the reactive forms to read the values of the form so for that we will write getter function which will return all the form controls.
	So after that we can apply validations.
	
Template Driven Vs Reactive Fomrs:
	Template Driven Fomrs:
	1. Maximum things will be handled at html side.
	2. Easy to code for simple use.
	3. Validations are more complicated.
	4. Complex for testing
	5. Use ngModel
