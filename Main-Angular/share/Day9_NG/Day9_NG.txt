Task: Compare two dates in JS. calculate your age in temrs of days. 



Custom Directives:
	If we need to perfomrm some DOM related tasks throught the application then we prefer for custom directives.
	We can create custom directives using command: ng g d directiveName

	CLI : Command Line Interface.
	npm install @angular/cli -g ===> Install angular/ cli trought out the machine.

Constructor: 
	It is responsible for Object creation of the class.
	It is also responsible for dependency injection.
	It is not a part of angular component life cycle. 
	It is not a mandotory to write constructor in component, if we dont write angular will execute by default.
	
Angular Life cycle:
	Angular lifecycle consist of 8 lifecycle hooks or methods.
	depend on situation every method will be called.
	
	
	1) onChanges
	2) onInit
	3) doCheck
	4) afterContentInit
	5) afterContentCheck
	6) afterViewInit
	7) afterViewCheck
	8) ngDestroy
	
	
	1) onChanges(): This method will execute firth time when component came into picture/ came into DOM.
					Next time this method will call when there will be change in any input property of the component.
					
	2) onInit() : It is reponsible for initilization/ subscribe  all the variables inside the DOM.
					This method will be called after onChanges() method. 
					
					
	
	8) ngDestroy() : unsubscribe all the component initilized variables from the DOM and now DOM is ready to render next component.
	
	* onInit and ngDestroy methods will be called only once during lifecycle of the component 
				but all other methods will be called multiple times based on situation.
