Angular Deployment :

Deployment consist of two parts:
1. Transpilation: converting TS code in JS code.
2. Compilation: Converting JS code into minified JS code. 

Angular provides above both process by using single command: ng build 

Angular Provides two types of compilation:
Any application compiles inside the browswer during the runtime. 
1. JIT (Just in time compilation):
	If we change small part of code then entire code will be compiled once again.
	JIT compiler was used till Angular 12 version.
	

2. AOT (Ahead of time compilation): 
	If we change small part of code then only that part will be compiled not all other code.
	From Angular 13 onwards angular provides AOT as by default compilation option.
	Before angular 13, JIT compilation was by default and we need to pass the flag to compile our code with the help of AOT. 
	i.e ng build --aot (not required from angular 13 and above).
	Benefits:
		1. Faster rendering/ minimum loading time.
		2. Less API calls.
		3. Minimizing the errors.
		4. Better security.
		
Webpack: Converting our whole application small chunks is called as webpack.
