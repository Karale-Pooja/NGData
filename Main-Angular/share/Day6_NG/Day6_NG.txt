* Angular Forms:
	Forms are used to collect the data from users.
	In angular there are two types of forms: i.e Template Driven Form and Reactive Forms.
	
	Template Driven Forms:
	Maximum things will be handled at html side.
	We need to use ngModel to bind the data.
	We can add the validations in template driven forms.
	
	To Submit the data of the user:
	comp.html ===> comp.ts ===> angular service ===> backend ===> database. 
	
	To get the response after saving the form: 
	database ====> backend ===> angular service ====> comp.ts ===> comp.html.
