Agnular Pipes:

	Pipes are responsible for tranforming one format of data into another format of data.
	There are two types of pipes i.e. built in pipe and custom pipe. 
	Buil in Pipes: uppercase, lowercase, titlecase, date, json, slice, currency pipes.
	
	We can create custom pipe with CLI commands: ng g p pipeName
	
	If we want to convert data throght out the application as per the user's requirements then we can implement custom Pipes.
	
	Pipetransform is the interface used in custom pipe. 
	transform is the method reposponsible for converting the data from one format to another format.
	and this method is coming from pipetranform interface.
