Angular Promises:
	Promises has been added in ES6.
	Promises are async or parellal flow of execution which can handle single event at a time.
	e.g.: 1...2...3...4...5... ===> observable response
		  12345 ====> Promise response
		  
	Promises gives only one value.
	Promises has two states:
	Running state:
		resolve(): It means promise has been successfully executed.
		reject(): It means promise has not been successfully executed.
	
	pending state: 
		promise is yet to execute.
	promises can not be cancelled.
	Promises are used to handle http calls.
	
	
										*** Observable Vs Promise:
		Obs: Can handle multiple events at a time.           prom: can handle single event at a time.
		obs: lazy in nature									 prom: quicker in nature.
		obs: obs are cancellable.							 prom: are not cancellable.
		obs: came from package RxJS.						 prom: added in ES6.
		obs: need to subscribe.								 prom: no need to subscribe
		obs: can handle next, complete, error				 prom: can handle either resolve or reject.
