Angular Unit Test Cases:

There are three types of tests:
1. Unit Tests
2. Integration tests
3. End-to-end test 

Unit Testing in angular :

It is a process of exminining or testing the specific part of application to make sure it is working fine or not.

Benefits:

	1. Chances of less error after deployment of the code.
	2. Code refactoring for testing purpose.
	3. If we are adding any new feature to the application then will easily understand our application is breaking or not at the level of development.
	
		To write an angular test cases we require two major things :
		
		1. Jasmine:
			It is an open sourse testing framework/ library.
			Using the Jasmine we can write the test cases. 
			Jasmine provides few important methods: 
			it(): Declare a perticular test.
			describe(): It is suite for test the it().
			expect(): It is used to expect or compare the result value.
			
		2. Karma: 
		It is runnner used to run/ execute unit test cases.
		It will provide result as well as code coverage in terms of %.
		
		
		To test the application we have command: ng test 
		To see the code coverage we have the command: ng test --code-coverage
