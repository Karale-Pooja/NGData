Basic Building Blocks of Angular:

1. Module
2. Component
3. Template
4. Decorator/ Metadata
5. Service
6. Depenjency Injection
7. Data Binding.

1 . Modules:
	Modules are collection of classes and code at single point.
	Modules has been introduced in ES6.
	Module also consist of import, export, provider, bootstrap.
	There are two types of modules in angular . i.e root module and feature module.
	AppModule is root module so from main.ts call will go to appModule.
	We can chnage our root module from main.ts.
	We can create feature module with the help of command: ng g m moduleName
	
2. Component:
	Complete is angular is based on component architecture.
	component is collection of class, template and decorator.
	Each comp is having four files:
	comp.html: include html code
	comp.css: include css code 
	comp.ts: TS code ans business logic. 
	comp.spec.ts: include test cases.
	we can create feature component with the help of command: ng g c compName
	component class consist of methods and properties.
	
	* Every angular project should having atleast one root module and one root component.
	Angular project can have zero or n number of feature module as well as feature component.
	By default app comp is root component.
	Every comp has its own selector.
	with the help of selector we can call the component.
	
	** Every component can have multiple root components. bcoz in app module file we have bootstrap as an array so we can give multiple components**
	
3. Template: It is combination of html and css file.

4. Decorator : Decorator tells to angular how to process on class.

5. Metadata: Metadata is data about data. or extra information about the data.


** Flow of Angular: 

	ng serve/ npm start ===> angular.json ===> main.ts ===> app. module ===> app.comp ===> index.html

		1) angular.json: first entry point of angular project. 
						 From this file call will go to the main.ts bcoz path of main.ts file is given inside angular.json file.
						 
		2) main.ts: It is an second entry point of my angular application. This file is responsible for bootstraping process.
					In this file we have mentioned bootstrap module as app module so call will go to the app module file.
					
		3) app module: There are two types of modules i.e. root module and feature module. App module is root module. 
						this module consist of import, export, class, providers, boostrap.
						
		4) app.comp: Comp consist of class, template and decorator. Comp is having selector. consist of four files i.e. .html, .css, .ts, .spec.ts.
					Then the slector of app comp has been called in index.html file.
					
		5) index.html: It is repsonsible for SPA. This is the only file which will be loaded in the browswer.
