Operators: what is operators?

Types of operators:

(1)Arithmatic operators:

                   operator                Discription
                   +                        Addition
                   -                        substraction
                   *                       multiplication
                   **                      exponential
                   /                        division
                   %                        modulus(remainder)
                   ++                       increment
                   --                       decrement

 (2)Comparison operator:
  (output should be only true or only false.)

                  operator                 Discription
                  ==                       equal to
                  ===                      equal value and equal type           
                  !=                       not equal
                  !==                      not equal value and not equal type  
                  >                        greater than
                  <                        less than
                  >=                       greater than or equal to
                  <=                       less than or equal to

(3)Logical operator:
                   operator                  Discription
                   &&                        AND (both condition must be true)
                   ||                        OR  (from both condition one should be true)
                   !                         NOT (output will be in reverse mannar) 

(4) Assignment operator:
                        +=                    + equal to
                        -=                    - equal to  

(5) Bitwise operator:
(It works on bits i.e 32 bit numbers)
                     &                        AND (set each bit to 1 if both of two bits is 1)
                     |                        OR  (set each bit to 1 if one of bits is 1)
                     ~                        NOT  (Invert all the bits)
