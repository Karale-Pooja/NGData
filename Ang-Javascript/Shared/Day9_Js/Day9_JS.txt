Javascript Navigation:

	If we want to navigate from one page to another page based on some particular condition then we can use window.location.
	
	syntax:
	window.location = "url";
	
	Dialog Boxes:
		
		1. Alert
		2. Confimr
		3. Prompt
		
	1. Alert: 
		Only one option will be available i.e. OK to accept the terms and condition.
		User doesn't have any another option.
		Using alert we can show warning message.
		syntax: alert("Show message");
		Exection will be stopped until user accepts the condition.
		
	2. Confimr:
		Will have two options. i.e OK and Cancel.
		based on Ok and Cancel we can write our business logic.
		
		syntax:
		confirm("Are you sure u want to continue? ");
		
	3. Prompt:
		Will have two options with free text as input where user can enter the values.
		And based on user values we can write business logic.
		
		syntax:
		prompt("Plz enter your age");
