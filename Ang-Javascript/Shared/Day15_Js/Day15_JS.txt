Javascript Basics:

	JS is single threaded synchronous scripting langugage means execution will be done by line by line and in sequential manner.
	
	Asynchronous: Ability to handle multiple events at a time. Exectuion is based on the program.
	
	JS need to convert from synchronous to asynchronous. For that JS is giving multiple approaches.
	
	1. Timer
	2. Callback
	3. Promise
	4. async/ await
	5. Observables
	
	Timer:
	setTimeOut: It is going to execute after given time in milisecond. No need to give a call to function.
	
	setInterval: It is going to execute after each given time in milisecond. No need to give a call to function.
				 To clear the the setInterval we need to call an clearInterval function.
				 
	SetImmediate: Used to execute a function right after the current event loop finishes.
				 
	Callback Function: Function which is passed as an argument to another function that inside is called as call back function.
	
	Anonymous Function: The function which doesn't have name is called as anynoumous function.
	
	
	Local Scope VS Global Scope: 
	
	1. Global Scope: Variable can access through out the js file.
	2. Functional Scope : Variable is having scope inside function only.
	3. Block Scope : Variable is having scope inside block. block is nothing within two curly brackets.
	
	Let: Let is having block scope variable.
