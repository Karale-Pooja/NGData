ES 6 Features Continue...:
Object Oriented JS:

1. Classes:
	Class is a blue print of Object. Class consists of properties and functions and constructor.
	
2. Inheritance :
	It is an mechanism where child class inherits/ implements/ access properties of parent class.
	
3. Prototypal Inheritance:
	One object or child object will acces methods and properties of parent objects is called as prototypal inheritance.
	

Temporal Dead Zone:
	Let and const always goes in temporal dead zone i.e from when called the varilable until we initilize that variable with some value.
	var variable will occupy memory in global area so they can be accessed with this or window. But will let and const can not access like that.

use strict :
	JS is asking for stictness of all the methods and properties.
