                        seeking a probe into former Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal's change of stance on opening of
                        liquor shops in unauthorised areas. "The cabinet's policy was earlier cleared by former LG, but
                        the decision was later revoked. This led to losses worth thousands of crores," Sisodia claimed.
