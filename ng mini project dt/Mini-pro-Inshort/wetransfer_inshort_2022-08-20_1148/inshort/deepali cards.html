                 Haw! How 'controversial'." Reports claimed the bag was priced over ₹1.5 lakh.

                 He asserted that his government only forged "a natural alliance of Shiv Sena once again". "We took this decision because...in...upcoming elections, Shiv Sena would have had only that many MLAs as...can be counted on fingers," he added.

                it has become a "weapon of mass destruction". "It's ridiculous that they (ED) raid the premises of a publication whose transactions are anyway captured in the books of accounts," he said.
