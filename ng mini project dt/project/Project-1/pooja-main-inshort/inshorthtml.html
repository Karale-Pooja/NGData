                        <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted his Turkish counterpart Recep Erdogan in Sochi on
                            Friday. The war in Ukraine and the situation in Syria were said to be on the agenda. This is
                            the second meeting between the leaders since Turkey supported an agreement between Russia
                            and Ukraine last month to provide a safe sea route to ship trapped grain stocks.
